# sdp_capstone_project CLASS PROJECT

**Project Description:**

This project serves as an academic exploration of design patterns in Python, using Odoo as a platform for demonstration. While the project utilizes Odoo, it deliberately avoids relying on core functionalities/modules such as accounting/invoicing module. Instead, it focuses solely on leveraging the Contacts and Stock modules with minimal dependency, which will eventually be discarded, aligning with the project's educational objectives.

It encompasses patient management, medical records, and inventory tracking, while integrating with automated invoicing, payments, accounts reconciliation, general ledgers, and messaging.

**Design Patterns Utilized:**
1. **Adapter Pattern:** 
2. **Observer Pattern:** 
3. **Factory Pattern:**
