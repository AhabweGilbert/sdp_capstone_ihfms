# sdp_capstone_project CLASS PROJECT

**Project Description:**

This project serves as an academic exploration of design patterns in Python, using Odoo as a platform for demonstration. While the project utilizes Odoo, it deliberately avoids relying on core functionalities/modules such as accounting/invoicing module despite the billing function in this project. 

It encompasses patient management, medical records, and inventory tracking, while integrating with automated invoicing, payments, accounts reconciliation, general ledgers, and messaging.

**Design Patterns Utilized:**
1. **Adapter Pattern:** 
2. **Observer Pattern:** 
3. **Factory Pattern:** 

Note on Academic vs. Business Orientation:

It is important to emphasize that this project is driven by academic objectives. Therefore, the focus lies on demonstrating the principles and implementations of design patterns in a controlled environment.
